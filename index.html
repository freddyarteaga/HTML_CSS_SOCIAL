              <h1>The Best Guitarists of All time</h1> <br>
              <p>As soon as you decide to learn the guitar, you’ll need to familiarize yourself 
                with all the great guitarists who have come before you.

                Whether you’re a fan of classical, folk, rock, hard rock or funk music, each genre
                 has its canon of great guitarists who have popularized it and propelled it forward.
                  And, honestly, people are always willing to argue about who the best guitar player is.
                
                Off the top of our heads, we can name Hendrix, Robert Johnson, Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, 
                Django Reinhardt, Slash, Jimmy Page, BB King and countless others.

                  It’s a debated subject for music fans who all have their own preferred musician or 
                  group for reasons that are extremely diverse and personal: for some, the technical skills 
                  of the guitarist are the deciding factor, and for others, it’s a question of emotion.

                  And for others still, it comes down to how much commercial success the guitarist in question 
                  has had. Some will want Joe Satriani, and others will want James Hetfield. Some will want Chet 
                  Atkins, others will want John Frusciante.

                    So basically we had many criteria to take into account as we ranked the most renowned guitarists. 
                    However, they can’t all be in there.

                    <h2>How to Define the Greatest Guitarists?</h2>
                  <p> 

                    Of course, as we say, it is a tricky game to play, this. Because how can you compare a genius 
                    fingerstyle acoustic player to a rock guitarist, or a jazz guitar genius to a rhythm guitar player
                     who plays power chords but exceptionally?
                    
                    Can you compare them? Is it even a worthwhile exercise comparing Malmsteen to ZZ Top or Aerosmith?
                     It’s like writing a list of greatest artists or greatest albums of all time – with entries spanning 
                     everything from grunge
                      to the bluesy to punk rock and rock&roll – with criteria including songwriting and improvisation. 
                      These are very 
                      different skills and need to be considered as such. Just as they are very different skills in metal 
                      guitar, eighties jazz, 
                      and acoustic fingerpicking.

                      <h3>Firstly, What Makes Good Music In General?</h3>
                  <p>
                      Before we can attempt to define who a good guitar player is, we should first of all draw our attention 
                      to the science of music and the question, what actually makes good music? Why is it, for instance, that
                       some sequences of chords are like music to our ears whereas others can only be described as noise?
                      
                      If you think about it logically and objectively, musicians often go into the business because they know 
                      it means (or at least it can mean) money and popularity.
