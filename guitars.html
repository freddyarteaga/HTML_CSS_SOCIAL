            <h1>THE BEST GUITARS FOR ROCK: 3 OPTIONS YOU NEED TO TRY</h1>

            <p>You’ve got your favourite guitar heroes and you’ve got your style of music, and in this case, it’s ROCK! Whether your favourite band is the Foo Fighters, or AC/DC, you love to air guitar to Zeppelin or Queens of the Stone Age you’ll likely want to emulate or at the very least take inspiration from some of your heroes when choosing a guitar. Guitarists spend years honing their technique and tone, and the guitars they play, are a huge part of their sound – so if you want to sound like AC/DC then you’ll need an SG, or if you want to sound like Wolfmother, you’ll need a 335 and so on.

                    There’s a reason why certain models are known as the best rock guitars, whether it’s down to pickup configuration, body construction or even the likes of the bridge that holds the strings to your guitar – and there’s plenty of reasons why these models appear time and time again on a stage. However, due to the sheer number of guitars out there, you’re probably finding it a little hard to choose the right guitar for you, so we’re going to look at some of the most commonly used models and what makes these particular items the best guitars for rock.

                <p>
                        Let’s start with an absolute classic of rock. The Fender Stratocaster has been a staple of rock music since the day it was released back in 1954 and has been a constant in the brand’s line-up since day one. In fact, this guitar, alongside the Gibson Les Paul, is one of the most emulated guitar shapes in the musical world with many other brands choosing to take “inspiration” from the Strat look. The double cutaway guitar was originally intended for country players as Leo Fender happened to be a huge country fan, however, this guitar has been one of the most widely used setups appearing in all musical genres, with the humbucking pickup configuration appearing in the harder rock style bands too. Legends such as Jimi Hendrix, to Clapton, to Pink Floyd and everyone in between has played one of these, with the likes of Biffy Clyro showing just how awesome the single coil can sound when you throw some distortion at it.

                        There have been some very minor, but very important adjustments to the beloved “strat” over the years with 2016 seeing the birth of the N4 noiseless pickups that eradicated any unwanted hum. The improved modern “D” profile neck featured on the Fender American Vintage ’59 Stratocaster is also a dream to play.

                <p>
                        The Gibson Flying V has to be a contender for most striking design ever. One can only imagine what people thought about this design when it was first introduced in 1958. Jimi Hendrix toured with a Flying V in 1967 through 1968 and it is believed that his iconic cover of ‘All Along The Watchtower’ features a Flying V heavily. These days you’re likely to see Lenny Kravitz playing his signature model and watching Mastodon’s Brent Hinds busting out some serious rock riffs on his signature Epiphone Flying V. Aside from the fact that it’s extremely eye-catching, it’s the mixture of humbucking pickups, stop bar tailpiece and the beautiful mahogany body and neck that really gives this guitar its rock tone.

Whether you want high gain riffs, long sustained notes or subtle nuances, the Flying V can do it all. The Gibson 2019 Flying V, for example, features Dirty Fingers+ ceramic pickups that blend beautifully with the rich mahogany tonewood offering gorgeous sustain and the higher gain when you need it. A great option if you’re in a rock band and not only want to sound the part but look it too without being gimmicky.

                <p>
                        This striking guitar was introduced in 1962 and achieved notoriety throughout the surf music scene before being discontinued in 1975. Interestingly, Jaguars then became highly sought after throughout the punk rock scene and eventually synonymous with the alternative and indie scene of the 80s and 90s thanks to the likes of Johnny Mar, Scott Hill, John Squire, Kurt Cobain, Kevin Shields, Black Francis, J Mascis, Thurston Moore, John Frusciante and a whole lot more players championing this extremely versatile instrument.

There is a surprising amount of control over your sound considering you only have 2 pickups to play with, however with the variety of switches with integrated rhythm and lead circuits the Special Design Hot single-coil Jaguar pickups really come to life. The infamous AdjustoMatic bridge with vintage style floating tremolo tailpiece and tremolo lock button all contribute to the beautiful and highly sought after sound of the guitar.
